# 📁 ManagerMateriale

A simple **file manager web app** built with **Flask** and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project was created as a way to **learn how backend and frontend technologies work together**, focusing on file handling, templates, and dynamic content rendering in Flask.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

I built this project to:
- Understand **Flask routing** and rendering dynamic HTML templates
- Work with **file uploads**, storage, and deletion in Python
- Generate simple **statistics** from files (types, sizes, counts)
- Use **TailwindCSS** directly in the browser for fast and modern UI design
- Practice building small but complete full-stack web apps

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Flask** — backend web framework
- **HTML + TailwindCSS** — responsive frontend styling
- **Jinja2 templates** — dynamic content rendering
- **Local file system** — used to store uploaded files

---
